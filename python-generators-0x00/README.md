 Python MySQL Seeder ‚Äì seed.py
This project sets up and populates a MySQL database named ALX_prodev with user data from a CSV file. It demonstrates the use of Python with MySQL for database setup, schema creation, and data insertion.

Features
Connects to a MySQL server

Creates a database if it doesn't exist

Creates a user_data table with appropriate schema

Loads and inserts data from a CSV file (user_data.csv)

Prevents duplicate entries using primary key checks

Table Structure: user_data
Field	Type	Constraints
